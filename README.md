# Submodule for KOS: libgen86

This repository is a sub-module for [KOS](https://github.com/GrieferAtWork/KOSmk4) and exists for the sole purpose to allow other projects to make use of the collection of macros for generating x86 bytecode.

Currently, [KOSmk4](https://github.com/GrieferAtWork/KOSmk4) (for its `libservice` interprocess API sub-system) and [deemon](https://github.com/GrieferAtWork/deemon) (for its `_hostasm` re-compiler) use this library, but that might change in the future (I'm looking at you, ...)
